# Future Development Guidelines

## Critical Dependencies
- **FINNHUB_API_KEY**: Required environment variable for all financial agents
- **Strands Agents SDK**: Core framework for agent creation and coordination
- **finnhub-python>=2.4.18**: Primary financial data source (replaced yfinance)
- **python-dotenv>=1.0.0**: Environment variable management

## Key Migration Patterns Applied
All financial agents now follow this enhanced pattern:

1. **API Integration**: 
   ```python
   import finnhub
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   
   load_dotenv()
   api_key = os.getenv('FINNHUB_API_KEY')
   finnhub_client = finnhub.Client(api_key=api_key)
   ```

2. **Error Handling**:
   ```python
   if not api_key:
       return {"status": "error", "message": "FINNHUB_API_KEY not found"}
   ```

3. **Data Processing**:
   ```python
   # Finnhub endpoints used:
   quote = finnhub_client.quote(ticker)                    # Real-time quotes
   candles = finnhub_client.stock_candles(ticker, 'D', start, end)  # Historical data
   profile = finnhub_client.company_profile2(symbol=ticker) # Company info
   metrics = finnhub_client.company_basic_financials(ticker, 'all') # Financial ratios
   news = finnhub_client.company_news(ticker, _from, to)    # Company news
   ```

## Development Best Practices

### Adding New Financial Agents
1. Start with `@tool` decorator for functions
2. Add Finnhub API integration with error handling
3. Implement comprehensive data validation
4. Add web scraping fallbacks where appropriate
5. Create conversational agent wrapper with professional system prompts
6. Test with various ticker symbols and edge cases

### Extending Multi-Agent Patterns
1. **Mesh Pattern**: Use `swarm/FinancialResearch_MeshSwarm.py` as template
2. **Hierarchical Pattern**: Use `graph_IntelligentLoanUnderwriting/IntelligentLoanApplication_Graph.py` as template
3. **Sequential Pattern**: Use `WorkFlow_ClaimsAdjudication/ClaimsAdjudication_SequentialPattern.py` as template

### Common Development Tasks

#### Testing Financial Agent Integration
```bash
# Test individual agents
cd Finance-assistant-swarm-agent
python stock_price_agent.py
python financial_metrics_agent.py  
python company_analysis_agent.py

# Test swarm coordination
python finance_assistant_swarm.py
```

#### Adding New Data Sources
1. Add new API integration following Finnhub pattern
2. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. Update agent system prompts with new capabilities
4. Add comprehensive testing and validation

#### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **"FINNHUB_API_KEY not found"**: Create `.env` file with valid API key
- **"Module not found"**: Verify dependencies installed with `uv sync` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Rate limiting errors**: Built-in handling exists, but consider API usage patterns
- **Import errors**: Ensure all modules use updated import patterns (no yfinance references)
