## üèóÔ∏è Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Production Ready Components
1. **Financial Research & Analysis Swarm** (`Finance-assistant-swarm-agent/`)
   - Collaborative swarm pattern with 4 specialized agents
   - Real-time stock analysis, news aggregation, financial metrics
   - Interactive CLI, Amazon Nova Pro integration

2. **Claims Adjudication Workflow** (`WorkFlow_ClaimsAdjudication/`)
   - Sequential workflow pattern with 6 processing stages
   - FNOL processing, fraud detection, settlement calculation
   - **Status**: Jupyter notebook - needs Python conversion

3. **Loan Underwriting System** (`graph_IntelligentLoanUnderwriting/`)
   - Hierarchical agent graph with 7 specialized agents
   - Multi-document processing, fraud detection, risk assessment
   - **Status**: Jupyter notebook - needs Python conversion

4. **Research Mesh Swarm** (`swarm/`)
   - Mesh communication pattern for financial research
   - Multi-perspective analysis with 4 agent types
   - **Status**: Jupyter notebook - needs Python conversion

### üîÑ Critical Next Steps
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Acquire AWS credentials for Strands Agents SDK
2. **WEEK 1**: Convert all Jupyter notebooks to Python modules (TASK-003)
3. **WEEK 1-2**: Implement production hardening (error handling, logging)
4. **ONGOING**: API key acquisition per priority order in TASKS.md

## üîë Environment Setup Requirements

### Essential API Keys (Priority Order)
1. **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** - Required for all development
2. **BLOOMBERG_API_KEY** - Enterprise financial data ($2000+/month, 2-4 week procurement)
3. **ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY** - Market data (free tier available, immediate signup)
4. **NEWS_API_KEY** - News aggregation (free tier available, immediate signup)

**Full API key list and procurement details**: See `.env` file and TASKS.md Priority sections

## üéØ Development Principles & Constraints

### Architecture Constraints
- **No Jupyter Notebooks**: All final code must be plain Python files
- **Cross-platform**: Support macOS, Windows, Linux
- **Enterprise-grade**: 60%+ reliability through constrained agent architectures
- **Deloitte-focused**: Professional consulting methodology integration

### Technical Requirements
- **SDK**: Strands Agents SDK with Amazon Bedrock integration
- **Models**: Amazon Nova Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Bedrock
- **Patterns**: Collaborative Swarm, Sequential Workflow, Hierarchical Graph, Mesh Communication
- **Security**: PII encryption, audit trails, compliance-ready

### Quality Standards
- 80%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive error handling
- Structured logging
- Cross-platform compatibility
- API rate limiting and circuit breakers

## üöÄ Context Resumption Checklist

When resuming development after `/clear context`:

- [ ] Read this file (`00-CONTEXT-INDEX.md`) for project overview
- [ ] Review `PRD.md` for current implementation status and architecture
- [ ] Check `TASKS.md` for current priorities and development guidelines
- [ ] Verify `.env` file exists with required API key stubs
- [ ] Confirm understanding of "no Jupyter notebooks" constraint
- [ ] Identify which component you're working on and read corresponding README
- [ ] Check if AWS credentials are configured (required for all development)

## üéØ Current Development Focus

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**: Convert Jupyter notebooks to production Python modules
- 3 critical notebooks identified for immediate conversion:
  - ClaimsAdjudication_SequentialPattern.ipynb ‚Üí claims_adjudication_workflow.py
  - IntelligentLoanApplication_Graph.ipynb ‚Üí loan_underwriting_system.py  
  - FinancialResearch_MeshSwarm.ipynb ‚Üí financial_research_swarm.py
- Add CLI interfaces, comprehensive error handling, structured logging
- Maintain all existing functionality while achieving 60%+ reliability target

**SECONDARY OBJECTIVES**: 
- API key acquisition per priority order (AWS credentials critical)
- Production hardening (error handling, rate limiting, circuit breakers)
- Comprehensive test suite with 80%+ coverage
- Enhanced security and compliance features (PII encryption, audit trails)
