## üîÑ In Progress

### Current Focus: API Key Acquisition
- [ ] **AWS Credentials** (CRITICAL - blocks all development)
  - Status: Waiting for manual acquisition
  - Required: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - Enable Amazon Bedrock and Nova Pro model access

### Next Immediate Tasks
- [ ] **TASK-003**: Jupyter Notebook to Python Conversion
  - 3 notebooks need conversion to eliminate .ipynb dependencies
  - Add CLI interfaces, proper logging, error handling
  - Target: Complete conversion within 1-2 weeks

---

## üö´ Blocked Items

### Blocked by API Keys
- [ ] All agent system testing (requires AWS Bedrock access)
- [ ] Enhanced financial data integration (requires Bloomberg/Refinitiv)
- [ ] News sentiment analysis (requires News API key)

### Blocked by Notebook Conversion
- [ ] Production deployment of Claims Adjudication
- [ ] Production deployment of Loan Underwriting  
- [ ] Production deployment of Research Swarm

---

## üìã Priority Queue (Next 2 Weeks) - UPDATED

### Week 1 Priorities (IMMEDIATE FOCUS)
1. **CRITICAL**: Acquire AWS credentials and test Strands Agents SDK connectivity
2. **CRITICAL**: Convert `ClaimsAdjudication_SequentialPattern.ipynb` ‚Üí `claims_adjudication_workflow.py`
3. **CRITICAL**: Convert `IntelligentLoanApplication_Graph.ipynb` ‚Üí `loan_underwriting_system.py`
4. **CRITICAL**: Convert `FinancialResearch_MeshSwarm.ipynb` ‚Üí `financial_research_swarm.py`

### Week 2 Priorities (PRODUCTION HARDENING)
1. **HIGH**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging across all systems
2. **HIGH**: Add CLI interfaces for all converted Python modules
3. **HIGH**: Create unified API key management system with fallback mechanisms
4. **HIGH**: Remove all .ipynb files after successful conversion and testing
5. **MEDIUM**: Begin comprehensive test suite implementation (80%+ coverage target)

## üîë API Key Acquisition Status

### Required Immediately
- [ ] **AWS Credentials** - CRITICAL, blocks all development
- [ ] **Alpha Vantage** - Free tier available, sign up at alphavantage.co
- [ ] **News API** - Free tier available, sign up at newsapi.org

### Enterprise Keys (2-4 week procurement)
- [ ] **Bloomberg API** - $2000+/month, contact Bloomberg sales
- [ ] **Refinitiv** - $1500+/month, contact Refinitiv sales

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] **Experian API** - Credit data for loan underwriting
- [ ] **MSCI ESG** - ESG ratings for compliance features
- [ ] **Polygon.io** - $99/month for enhanced market data

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Made

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Strands Agents SDK
- **Models**: Amazon Nova Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet via Bedrock
- **CLI Framework**: Click or argparse for user interfaces
- **Logging**: Python logging module with structured output
- **Testing**: pytest with 80%+ coverage requirement

### Development Constraints
- **No Jupyter Notebooks**: All final code must be plain Python
- **Cross-platform Support**: macOS, Windows, Linux compatibility
- **Enterprise Security**: PII encryption, audit trails, compliance-ready
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in throttling for external API calls

---

## üö® Risk Items & Mitigation

### High Risk
- **AWS Access Delay**: All development blocked without Bedrock access
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize AWS credential acquisition immediately
- **Enterprise API Procurement**: Long sales cycles for Bloomberg/Refinitiv
  - *Mitigation*: Start procurement process early, use free alternatives for development

### Medium Risk  
- **Notebook Conversion Complexity**: Risk of functionality loss during conversion
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing of converted modules, maintain functionality parity
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Different behavior across operating systems
  - *Mitigation*: Test on all target platforms, use cross-platform libraries

## üìù Notes & Observations

### Development Approach
- Focus on maintaining existing functionality while improving reliability
- Prioritize immediate-impact items (notebook conversion) over nice-to-have features
- Build enterprise-grade error handling and logging from the start
- Design for horizontal scaling and high availability

### Team Collaboration
- Use this status file to communicate progress and blockers
- Update completion status as work is finished
- Add new risks and mitigation strategies as they arise
- Maintain clear priorities to avoid scope creep
