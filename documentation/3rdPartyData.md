## Key Considerations for Early-Stage Development:

* **Rate Limits:** Pay close attention to the free tier's daily or monthly request limits. These are crucial for not unexpectedly hitting paywalls during development.
* **Data Latency:** "Real-time" data might still have a small delay (e.g., 15 minutes), which is often fine for early-stage development but important to be aware of if you plan for truly live applications.
* **Data Coverage:** Ensure the API covers the specific exchanges, asset classes (stocks, ETFs, crypto), and historical depth you need.
* **Documentation and Support:** Good documentation and responsive support can significantly speed up your development process.
* **Terms of Service:** Always review the terms of service, especially regarding commercial use, if you plan to eventually monetize your software.

By exploring these alternatives, you should be able to find a reliable and cost-effective source of financial data for your early-stage investment software development.
