# Implementation Examples

This repository contains production-ready implementations demonstrating multi-agent systems for three critical financial services use cases:

## 1. Autonomous Claims Adjudication System
**Pattern**: Sequential Workflow

**Business Process**: Process First Notification of Loss (FNOL), retrieve policy details, assess damages, validate information against external sources (e.g., repair shop estimates), and settle claims.

**Implementation**: Sequential multi-agent workflow with clear dependencies and state management for consistent claim processing.

**Key Components**:
- **FNOL Processing Agent**: Data extraction, validation, and structuring from insurance claim documents
- **Policy Verification Agent**: Coverage determination and eligibility validation against policy databases
- **Fraud Detection Agent**: Risk assessment and suspicious indicator analysis with machine learning models
- **Damage Appraisal Agent**: Cost estimation and market rate validation through external pricing APIs
- **Settlement Calculation Agent**: Final payout determination with regulatory adjustments and compliance checks
- **Final Review Agent**: Quality assurance checkpoint with human oversight triggers and audit trail generation

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Location**: `WorkFlow_ClaimsAdjudication/ClaimsAdjudication_SequentialPattern.py`
- **Coordination**: Strands SDK workflow tools with task dependencies
- **Data Processing**: JSON/PDF document processing for FNOL and claims data
- **Integration**: External pricing APIs, fraud detection databases, policy management systems

**Business Value**: 
- Reduced processing time from days to hours
- Improved consistency in claim adjudication decisions
- Enhanced customer experience through faster claim resolution
- Significant reduction in manual processing errors and human bias

## 2. Automated Financial Research and Analysis Platform  
**Pattern**: Mesh Swarm

**Business Process**: An agentic system that ingests financial reports and news from multiple sources, evaluates risks and investment opportunities, and generates summary reports with key insights.

**Implementation**: Collaborative swarm architecture enabling multi-perspective analysis through direct agent-to-agent communication.

**Key Components**:
- **Stock Price Agent**: Real-time and historical price data analysis with technical indicators
- **Financial Metrics Agent**: Comprehensive fundamental analysis including P/E ratios, profit margins, and growth metrics
- **Company Analysis Agent**: Multi-source intelligence gathering from web scraping and news aggregation
- **News Analysis Agent**: Sentiment analysis and market impact assessment from financial news sources
- **Orchestration Agent**: Swarm coordination and comprehensive report synthesis

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Location**: `Finance-assistant-swarm-agent/finance_assistant_swarm.py`
- **Coordination**: Collaborative swarm pattern with shared memory systems
- **Data Sources**: Finnhub API for financial data, multi-source web scraping for enhanced intelligence
- **Models**: Amazon Nova Pro for financial analysis and reasoning

**Business Value**:
- Accelerated financial analysis cycles from hours to minutes
- Improved risk identification through multi-agent cross-validation
- Enhanced decision-making accuracy across multiple data streams
- Comprehensive market intelligence with real-time updates

## 3. Intelligent Loan Underwriting System
**Pattern**: Hierarchical Graph

**Business Process**: Orchestrates the entire loan origination process, from validating customer information across different systems to running validation checks via APIs and scheduling tasks.

**Implementation**: Hierarchical multi-agent graph with executive-manager-specialist delegation patterns for comprehensive risk assessment.

**Key Components**:
- **Executive Level**:
  - Loan Underwriting Supervisor Agent: Final decision-making authority and process orchestration
- **Manager Level**:
  - Financial Analysis Manager: Credit assessment and income verification coordination
  - Risk Analysis Manager: Risk scoring oversight and fraud detection management
- **Specialist Level**:
  - Credit Assessment Agent: FICO score analysis and credit history evaluation
  - Verification Agent: Income, employment, and asset validation through external APIs
  - Risk Calculation Agent: Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and Exposure at Default (EAD) modeling
  - Fraud Detection Agent: Synthetic identity detection and document authenticity verification
  - Policy Documentation Agent: Regulatory compliance validation and audit trail generation

**Technical Architecture**:
- **Location**: `graph_IntelligentLoanUnderwriting/IntelligentLoanApplication_Graph.py`
- **Coordination**: Hierarchical agent graph with clear delegation patterns
- **Document Processing**: Multi-document PDF analysis (credit reports, bank statements, tax returns, pay stubs)
- **Risk Modeling**: Quantitative risk assessment with regulatory compliance frameworks

**Business Value**:
- Faster loan processing with reduced time-to-decision
- Significantly reduced fraud risk through multi-layered detection
- Improved lending decision accuracy with comprehensive risk assessment
- Enhanced regulatory compliance with automated audit trails
- Consistent application of underwriting standards across all applications
