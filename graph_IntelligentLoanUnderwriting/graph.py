Building Multi-Agent Systems with Strands Agent Graph

This module provides comprehensive implementations and examples of multi-agent systems
using the Strands Agent Graph tool. It demonstrates different topology patterns including
star, mesh, and hierarchical architectures for various real-world applications.

The module covers:
- Agent graph fundamentals and core components
- Topology pattern implementations (star, mesh, hierarchical)
- Natural language interface for agent graph management
- PDF document processing for agent analysis
- Best practices for multi-agent system design
