# Hierarchical Multi-Agent System Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for hierarchical multi-agent systems using the FSI-MAS loan underwriting implementation. The hierarchical pattern uses tree structures with clear parent-child relationships, making it ideal for financial services processes requiring clear authority lines and specialized expertise.

## System Architecture

### Hierarchical Structure

The loan underwriting system implements a 3-tier hierarchy:

**Executive Level:**
- `loan_underwriting_supervisor_agent` - Overall coordination and final decisions

**Manager Level:**
- `financial_analysis_manager` - Coordinates credit and verification specialists
- `risk_analysis_manager` - Oversees risk calculation and fraud detection
- `policy_documentation_agent` - Handles documentation and compliance

**Specialist Level:**
- `credit_assessment_agent` - Credit history evaluation
- `verification_agent` - Income and asset validation  
- `risk_calculation_agent` - Quantitative risk modeling
- `fraud_detection_agent` - Fraud pattern identification

### Agent Communication Flow

1. **User Request → Supervisor Agent**
2. **Supervisor → Manager Agents** (parallel delegation)
3. **Managers → Specialist Agents** (domain-specific tasks)
4. **Specialists → Managers** (results aggregation)
5. **Managers → Supervisor** (consolidated analysis)
6. **Supervisor → User** (final decision)

## Testing Framework

### Test Suite: `test_hierarchical_agents.py`

The comprehensive test suite validates all aspects of hierarchical agent functionality:

#### Test 1: Document Processing
- **Purpose**: Validate PDF document extraction and analysis
- **Documents Tested**: 7 loan application documents (29 pages total)
- **Validation**: Content extraction, document type identification, importance scoring

#### Test 2: Fraud Detection
- **Purpose**: Test fraud pattern recognition and risk scoring
- **Features**: Cross-document consistency, identity verification, risk assessment
- **Outputs**: Fraud score, risk level, specific indicators, recommendations

#### Test 3: System Creation
- **Purpose**: Verify hierarchical agent graph creation and initialization
- **Components**: Agent topology, role definitions, communication edges
- **Validation**: System status, graph creation success

#### Test 4: Agent Communication
- **Purpose**: Test hierarchical communication patterns and role definitions
- **Validation**: Agent hierarchy structure, role specifications, communication principles

#### Test 5: Loan Processing (End-to-End)
- **Purpose**: Complete loan application processing through all hierarchy levels
- **Process**: Document extraction → Agent analysis → Decision synthesis
- **Outputs**: Loan decision, confidence score, supporting analysis

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. Import Errors
**Symptom**: `ImportError: No module named 'strands'`
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd graph_IntelligentLoanUnderwriting
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. AWS Credentials
**Symptom**: `NoCredentialsError` during agent graph creation
**Solution**: Configure AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
# OR set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

#### 3. Document Processing Failures  
**Symptom**: PDF files not found or extraction errors
**Solution**: Verify sample documents exist:
```bash
ls graph_IntelligentLoanUnderwriting/data/*.pdf
```

#### 4. Agent Graph Creation Timeouts
**Symptom**: Test timeouts during system creation
**Solution**: 
- Check AWS Bedrock service availability
- Verify model access permissions
- Consider increasing timeout values

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Parallel Document Processing
```python
# Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent document extraction
import concurrent.futures

def process_documents_parallel(document_paths):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(process_single_doc, path): doc_type 
                  for doc_type, path in document_paths.items()}
        return {futures[future]: future.result() 
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)}
```

#### 2. Memory Management
```python
# Clean up agent graphs after testing
def cleanup_test_resources(system):
    try:
        system.shutdown_system()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Cleanup warning: {e}")
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Load Testing
```python
def test_concurrent_loan_processing():
    """Test multiple simultaneous loan applications."""
    systems = []
    for i in range(5):
        system = HierarchicalLoanUnderwritingSystem(f"load_test_{i}")
        systems.append(system)
    
    # Process applications concurrently
    # Measure response times and resource usage
```

### 2. Failure Simulation
```python
def test_agent_failure_recovery():
    """Test system behavior when individual agents fail."""
    # Simulate network failures
    # Test timeout handling
    # Verify graceful degradation
```

### 3. Document Variety Testing
```python
def test_diverse_document_types():
    """Test with various document formats and qualities."""
    # Test with scanned documents
    # Test with different PDF versions
    # Test with corrupted files
```

## Integration with CI/CD

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Data Management
- Use realistic but anonymized loan documents
- Maintain version control for test documents
- Regularly update test scenarios to match real-world patterns

### 2. Hierarchical Agent Design
- Define clear role boundaries between hierarchy levels
- Implement proper error escalation paths  
- Ensure deterministic communication patterns

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Track agent response times at each hierarchy level
- Monitor memory usage during document processing
- Measure end-to-end loan processing latency

### 4. Security Considerations
- Never use real customer data in tests
- Implement proper access controls for test environments
- Regularly audit agent interactions for compliance

## Comparison: Hierarchical vs Other Patterns

| Aspect | Hierarchical | Sequential | Mesh/Swarm |
|--------|-------------|------------|------------|
| **Control Structure** | Tree-based authority | Linear pipeline | Peer-to-peer |
| **Communication** | Parent-child only | Next-in-line | Any-to-any |
| **Scalability** | Vertical scaling | Limited by bottlenecks | Horizontal scaling |
| **Fault Tolerance** | Single points of failure | Chain reaction | Distributed resilience |
| **Use Cases** | Regulated processes | Simple workflows | Complex collaboration |
| **Testing Complexity** | Medium | Low | High |
