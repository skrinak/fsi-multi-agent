# Mesh Swarm Multi-Agent System Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for mesh swarm multi-agent systems using the FSI-MAS financial research implementation. The mesh pattern enables direct communication between all agents, creating rich information exchange and collaborative problem-solving capabilities ideal for complex financial analysis tasks.

## System Architecture

### Mesh Communication Pattern

The mesh swarm implements peer-to-peer communication where every agent can directly communicate with every other agent:

**Agent Network:**
- `research_agent` - Gathers and analyzes factual information and data
- `investment_agent` - Evaluates creative investment approaches and opportunities  
- `risk_agent` - Identifies potential risks and analyzes investment proposals
- `summarizer_agent` - Synthesizes insights into comprehensive recommendations

### Communication Flow

**Phase 1: Initial Analysis**
1. All agents analyze the same financial document independently
2. Each produces specialized insights from their domain perspective

**Phase 2: Mesh Communication** 
3. All agents share their findings with every other agent
4. Rich information exchange enables cross-validation and refinement

**Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement**
5. Each agent refines their analysis based on input from all other agents
6. Iterative improvement through multi-perspective feedback

**Phase 4: Synthesis**
7. Summarizer agent creates final recommendation incorporating all insights

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. AWS Bedrock Access Errors
**Symptom**: `AccessDeniedException: You don't have access to the model`
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials with Bedrock permissions
aws configure
# OR request model access in AWS Console
# Bedrock → Model access → Request access to required models
```

#### 2. Import Errors
**Symptom**: `ImportError: No module named 'strands'`
**Solution**:
```bash
cd swarm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Document Processing Failures
**Symptom**: PDF files not found or extraction errors
**Solution**: Verify financial documents exist:
```bash
ls swarm/data/*.pdf
# Expected: amzn-20241231-10K-Part-1&2.pdf, LEGALCORRESPONDENCE.pdf
```

#### 4. Agent Communication Timeouts
**Symptom**: Long delays during mesh communication phases
**Solution**:
- Reduce document size for testing
- Implement timeout mechanisms
- Consider parallel processing optimizations

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Parallel Agent Processing
```python
# Use ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent agent analysis
import concurrent.futures

def parallel_agent_analysis(agents, query):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        futures = {executor.submit(agent, query): name 
                  for name, agent in agents.items()}
        return {futures[future]: future.result() 
                for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures)}
```

#### 2. Rate Limiting Management
```python
# Implement exponential backoff for API calls
import time
import random

def execute_with_backoff(func, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return func()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                delay = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                time.sleep(delay)
            else:
                raise e
```

#### 3. Memory Management
```python
# Clean up large documents after processing
def cleanup_document_data(doc_data):
    if len(doc_data.get('text', '')) > 50000:
        doc_data['text'] = doc_data['text'][:5000] + "... [truncated]"
    return doc_data
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Stress Testing
```python
def test_large_document_processing():
    """Test with very large financial documents."""
    # Process multiple 10-K filings simultaneously
    # Measure memory usage and processing time
    # Validate output quality under stress
```

### 2. Failure Resilience
```python
def test_agent_failure_recovery():
    """Test system behavior when individual agents fail."""
    # Simulate network failures
    # Test partial result handling
    # Verify graceful degradation
```

### 3. Multi-Document Analysis
```python
def test_comparative_analysis():
    """Test comparative analysis across multiple companies."""
    # Analyze competing companies simultaneously
    # Cross-validate insights between analyses
    # Generate comparative investment recommendations
```

## Integration with CI/CD
