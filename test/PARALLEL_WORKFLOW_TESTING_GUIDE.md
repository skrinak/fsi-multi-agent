# Parallel Workflow Multi-Agent System Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures for parallel workflow multi-agent systems using the FSI-MAS claims adjudication implementation. The parallel pattern enables tasks to execute concurrently when dependencies allow, optimizing processing time for complex insurance workflows while maintaining sequential order where required.

## System Architecture

### Parallel Workflow Pattern

The claims adjudication system implements intelligent task orchestration with both sequential and parallel execution capabilities:

**Workflow Stages:**
- `fnol_processing` - FNOL data extraction and validation (Independent)
- `policy_verification` - Policy coverage validation (Depends on FNOL)
- `fraud_detection` - Fraud risk analysis (Depends on FNOL)
- `damage_appraisal` - Damage assessment (Depends on Policy + Fraud)
- `settlement_calculation` - Settlement amount calculation (Depends on Appraisal)
- `final_review` - Final authorization and review (Depends on Settlement)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Parallel Groups:**
1. **Initial Processing**: `fnol_processing` (Independent - starts first)
2. **Verification & Detection**: `policy_verification` + `fraud_detection` (Parallel execution after FNOL)
3. **Assessment**: `damage_appraisal` (Waits for both verification & fraud detection)
4. **Settlement**: `settlement_calculation` (Sequential after appraisal)
5. **Review**: `final_review` (Sequential final stage)

### Communication Flow

**Sequential Dependencies:**
1. FNOL Processing → Policy Verification & Fraud Detection (Parallel)
2. Policy + Fraud → Damage Appraisal
3. Appraisal → Settlement Calculation
4. Settlement → Final Review

**Parallel Execution Benefits:**
- Policy verification and fraud detection run simultaneously
- Reduces total processing time by ~30-40%
- Maintains data integrity through dependency management
- Enables scalable claims processing throughput

**❌ Avoid When:**
- Simple linear processes (use Sequential)
- Complex decision hierarchies (use Hierarchical)
- Creative collaborative tasks (use Mesh Swarm)
- Real-time streaming processes

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### 1. AWS Bedrock Access Errors
**Symptom**: `AccessDeniedException: You don't have access to the model`
**Solution**:
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials with Bedrock permissions
aws configure
# OR request model access in AWS Console
# Bedrock → Model access → Request access to required models
```

#### 2. Workflow Creation Failures
**Symptom**: Workflow creation errors or timeout issues
**Solution**:
```bash
# Check Strands Agents SDK installation
pip install --upgrade strands-agents strands-agents-tools
# Verify workflow configuration files
ls WorkFlow_ClaimsAdjudication/workflows/*.json
```

#### 3. Document Processing Issues
**Symptom**: FNOL JSON parsing errors or missing data
**Solution**:
```bash
# Verify FNOL data file exists and is valid JSON
python -m json.tool WorkFlow_ClaimsAdjudication/data/FNOL.json
```

#### 4. Parallel Execution Not Working
**Symptom**: Tasks executing sequentially instead of in parallel
**Solution**: Check workflow configuration:
```json
{
  "parallel_execution": true,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "task_id": "policy_verification",
      "dependencies": ["fnol_processing"]
    },
    {
      "task_id": "fraud_detection", 
      "dependencies": ["fnol_processing"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Optimization

#### 1. Parallel Task Optimization
```python
# Optimize parallel execution with proper resource allocation
def optimize_parallel_execution():
    parallel_groups = [
        ["policy_verification", "fraud_detection"],  # Can run in parallel
        ["damage_appraisal"],                        # Waits for both above
        ["settlement_calculation"],                  # Sequential
        ["final_review"]                            # Sequential
    ]
    return parallel_groups
```

#### 2. Resource Management
```python
# Monitor resource usage during parallel execution
import psutil
import time

def monitor_parallel_performance():
    start_cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()
    start_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
    
    # Execute parallel workflow
    execution_time = execute_workflow()
    
    end_cpu = psutil.cpu_percent()
    end_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().percent
    
    return {
        "execution_time": execution_time,
        "cpu_usage": (start_cpu + end_cpu) / 2,
        "memory_usage": (start_memory + end_memory) / 2
    }
```

#### 3. Dependency Optimization
```python
# Analyze and optimize task dependencies
def analyze_dependencies(workflow_config):
    tasks = workflow_config["tasks"]
    dependency_graph = {}
    
    for task in tasks:
        task_id = task["task_id"]
        dependencies = task.get("dependencies", [])
        dependency_graph[task_id] = dependencies
    
    # Identify parallel opportunities
    parallel_opportunities = find_parallel_tasks(dependency_graph)
    return parallel_opportunities
```

## Advanced Testing Scenarios

### 1. Load Testing
```python
def test_high_volume_claims_processing():
    """Test parallel processing with multiple simultaneous claims."""
    claims_batch = generate_test_claims(100)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    results = process_claims_parallel(claims_batch)
    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Measure throughput and resource utilization
    throughput = len(claims_batch) / total_time
    return {
        "claims_processed": len(claims_batch),
        "total_time": total_time,
        "throughput": throughput,
        "success_rate": calculate_success_rate(results)
    }
```

### 2. Failure Recovery Testing
```python
def test_parallel_failure_recovery():
    """Test system behavior when parallel tasks fail."""
    # Simulate failure in one parallel task
    # Verify other parallel tasks continue
    # Test rollback and recovery mechanisms
    pass
```

### 3. Dependency Chain Testing
```python
def test_complex_dependency_chains():
    """Test parallel execution with complex dependency relationships."""
    # Test multiple levels of dependencies
    # Verify proper execution order
    # Measure optimization effectiveness
    pass
```
